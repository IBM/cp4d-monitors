title: Cloud Pak for Data Watson Machine Learning Development Space Information
---

## Monitor Summary

This monitor will generate the following observations:  
- Number of Cloud Pak for Data Waston Machine Learning Deployment Spaces
- Number of Cloud Pak for Data Waston Machine Learning Deployments per space
- Number of Failed Cloud Pak for Data Waston Machine Learning Deployments per space
- Number of Online Cloud Pak for Data Waston Machine Learning Deployments per space
- Number of Batch Cloud Pak for Data Waston Machine Learning Deployments per space

## Monitor Requirements

In order for Watson Studio Job Information to be available, CCS (Common Core Services) must be available on the Cloud Pak for Data instance. Catridges like Watson Studio and Watson Machine Learning automatically install CCS as part of their dependencies. If CCS is not available, no watson studio job information is available.

## Administrative Credential Requirements

In order to retrieve the monitor data, the credential of admin user will be used. The default password of admin user is saved in the secret admin-user-details. You could use the below command to query the default password of the admin user..
```
oc extract secret/admin-user-details --keys=initial_admin_password --to=-
```
Once the password of the admin user is changed, please also change the password in the secret admin-user-details. 
```
oc set data secret/admin-user-details initial_admin_password=<new password>
```

## Deployment of the monitor

This monitor can be deployed using the IBM Cloud Pak Deployer or manually deployed using oc commands:
- [Cloud Pak Deployer](/monitors/cp4d-wml-deployment-space-info/deployer) 
- [Manual Deployment using oc commands](/monitors/cp4d-wml-deployment-space-info/manual)

## Monitor Source

Source folder containing the script can be found  [here (cp4d-wml-deployment-space-info).](https://github.com/IBM/cp4d-monitors/tree/main/cp4d-wml-deployment-space-info)

## Generated observations

Once the monitor is deployed, the following observations are available in IBM Cloud Pak for Data Metrics:

### Using the IBM Cloud Pak for Data Platform Management Events:

https://&lt;CP4D-BASE-URL&gt;/zen/#/platformManagement/events

On the Platform Management Events page the following entries are added:

### Using the IBM Cloud Pak for Data Prometheus endpoint
https://&lt;CP4D-BASE-URL&gt;/zen/metrics

It will generate 2 types of metrics:
- Actual Result metrics  
  These metrics contain the observed values
- Zen Watchdog metrics  
  These metrics are used by the Cloud Pak for Data Zen Watchdog to monitor the state and trigger notifications

**Actual Result metrics:**
- cp4dplatformwmldeploymentspaceinfo_overall_count
  Provides number of Cloud Pak for Data Waston Machine Learning Deployment Spaces
- cp4d_wml_deployment_space_deployed_count
  Provides number of Cloud Pak for Data Waston Machine Learning Deployments per space
- cp4d_wml_deployment_space_deployed_fail_count
  Provides number of Failed Cloud Pak for Data Waston Machine Learning Deployments per space
- cp4d_wml_deployment_space_deployed_count_online
  Provides number of Online Cloud Pak for Data Waston Machine Learning Deployments per space
- cp4d_wml_deployment_space_deployed_count_batch
  Provides number of Batch Cloud Pak for Data Waston Machine Learning Deployments per space
