title: Cloud Pak for Data Watson Machine Learning Development Space Job Information
---

## Monitor Summary

This monitor will generate the following observations:  
- Number of Cloud Pak for Data Waston Machine Learning Deployment Jobs across all spaces
- Number of Acitve Cloud Pak for Data Waston Machine Learning Deployment Jobs per space
- Status of Last Cloud Pak for Data Waston Machine Learning Deployment Job per space

## Monitor Requirements

In order for Watson Studio Job Information to be available, CCS (Common Core Services) must be available on the Cloud Pak for Data instance. Catridges like Watson Studio and Watson Machine Learning automatically install CCS as part of their dependencies. If CCS is not available, no watson studio job information is available.

## Administrative Credential Requirements

In order to retrieve the monitor data, the credential of admin user will be used. The default password of admin user is saved in the secret admin-user-details. You could use the below command to query the default password of the admin user..
```
oc extract secret/admin-user-details --keys=initial_admin_password --to=-
```
Once the password of the admin user is changed, please also change the password in the secret admin-user-details. 
```
oc set data secret/admin-user-details initial_admin_password=<new password>
```


## Deployment of the monitor

This monitor can be deployed using the IBM Cloud Pak Deployer or manually deployed using oc commands:
- [Cloud Pak Deployer](/monitors/cp4d-wml-deployment-space-job-info/deployer) 
- [Manual Deployment using oc commands](/monitors/cp4d-wml-deployment-space-job-info/manual)

## Monitor Source

Source folder containing the script can be found  [here (cp4d-wml-deployment-space-job-info).](https://github.ibm.com/CloudPakDeployer/cloud-pak-deployer-monitors/tree/master/cp4d-wml-deployment-space-job-info) 

## Generated observations

Once the monitor is deployed, the following observations are available in IBM Cloud Pak for Data Metrics:

### Using the IBM Cloud Pak for Data Platform Management Events:

https://&lt;CP4D-BASE-URL&gt;/zen/#/platformManagement/events

On the Platform Management Events page the following entries are added:

| Event   | Event Type      | Possible values | Description |
|:----------|:-------------|:------|:----------|
| Cloud Pak for Data Waston Machine Learning Deployment Space Jobs Overall Count |Number of Cloud Pak for Data Waston Machine Learning Deployment Jobs across all spaces |info| The Cloud Pak for Data Waston Machine Learning Spaces  information is requested. |
| Cloud Pak for Data Waston Machine Learning Deployment Space Active Count |Number of Acitve Cloud Pak for Data Waston Machine Learning Deployment Jobs per space |info| The Cloud Pak for Data Waston Machine Learning Spaces information is requested. |
| Cloud Pak for Data Waston Machine Learning Deployment Space Job Last Status |Status of Last Cloud Pak for Data Waston Machine Learning Deployment Job per space |info| The Cloud Pak for Data Waston Machine Learning Spaces and Jobs information are requested. |

### Using the IBM Cloud Pak for Data Prometheus endpoint
https://&lt;CP4D-BASE-URL&gt;/zen/metrics

It will generate 2 types of metrics:
- Actual Result metrics  
  These metrics contain the observed values
- Zen Watchdog metrics  
  These metrics are used by the Cloud Pak for Data Zen Watchdog to monitor the state and trigger notifications

**Actual Result metrics:**
- cp4d_wml_deployment_space_jobs_overall_count
  Provides number of Cloud Pak for Data Waston Machine Learning Deployment Jobs across all spaces
- cp4d_wml_deployment_space_jobs_active_count
  Provides number of Acitve Cloud Pak for Data Waston Machine Learning Deployment Jobs per space
- cp4d_wml_deployment_space_job_last_status
  Provides status of Last Cloud Pak for Data Waston Machine Learning Deployment Job per space
